## Installation
To set up the Healfive website on your environment, follow these steps:

1. Spin-up a site
If you do not yet have a Pantheon account, you can create one for free. Once you've verified your email address, you will be able to add sites from your dashboard. Choose "WordPress" to use this distribution.

2. Load up the site
When the spin-up process is complete, you will be redirected to the site's dashboard. Click on the link under the site's name to access the Dev environment.

3. Run the WordPress installer
How about the WordPress database config screen? No need to worry about database connection information as that is taken care of in the background. The only step that you need to complete is the site information and the installation process will be complete.

If you would like to keep a separate set of configuration for local development, you can use a file called wp-config-local.php, which is already in our .gitignore file.

4. Enjoy!
